  Welcome to the secret part of Jillian's Cookbook, for those curious enough to use Inspect element!
  My name is Will, and I'm the creator of this horror ARG. I can be reached best through my Discord
  @TheWill#4205. Please DM me with comments, concerns, bugs, queries, and most especially any web
  development job requests, since my projects are designed to showcase my skills :).

  Thank you so much for playing my game, and I hope that you're looking forward to more spooky or 
  generally cool projects in the future.
