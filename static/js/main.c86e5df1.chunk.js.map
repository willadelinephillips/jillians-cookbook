It's been my dream my entire life to have a food website. \r\n          Even when I was a little girl pretending to cook in my little pastic kitchen, I imagined \r\n          an audience that was watching me. I told them about the ingredients I was using, the way \r\n          I had decided to maket the recipe, and what personal touches I was adding. When I got \r\n          older, it was my way of connecting with those I love. My mother, my father, and my friends. \r\n          Our family didn't express a lot of love through words or hugs, but through our cooking \r\n          instead. When my mother passed, the primary thing she left me was her cookbook, full of \r\n          notes and tips and tricks. It's my most treasured possession.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>Thank you for being here, on my website with me. It means a lot to know that my dream \r\n          is being realized, no matter if you're a close personal friend or a stranger out here \r\n          on the 'Web.

The rest of the \r\n          rooms were untouched and organized, but the kitchen was bathed in swaths of blood from \r\n          the body of Miss Evans. Pieces of her were found by officers strewn across the floor, and \r\n          when detectives attempted to move her for autopsy, it was noted that more than 40% of her \r\n          body was completely missing. These missing pieces included both legs, both eyes, several \r\n          fingers on the right hand, and her entire left arm. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Although much of the information concerning the autopsy is still unknown to the public, \r\n          it appears that a potential suspect attempted to stem the bleeding as it took place with \r\n          kitchen supplies, but continued to remove pieces of her as they did. Her stomach was also \r\n          bloated and full, although it's as of yet unknown what she had eaten prior to being \r\n          murdered. \r\n        </p>\r\n        {!isShown && (\r\n        <p \r\n        onMouseEnter={() => setIsShown(true)}>\r\n          Detectives are at a total loss as to how the murder took place, as she clearly could not \r\n          have done so much damage to her own body without experiencing immense pain. Doors and \r\n          windows were locked, and there appears to be no sign of forced entry or misplaced decor. \r\n          The only object in front of her was a laptop computer, which was attuned to her website.\r\n        </p>\r\n        )}\r\n        {isShown && (\r\n        <p onMouseLeave={() => setIsShown(false)}>\r\n          SHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUS\r\n          SHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUS\r\n          SHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUS\r\n          SHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUSSHEWASDELICIOUS\r\n        </p>\r\n      )}\r\n      <p>\r\n\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n          The Valewind police force is out in full looking for a potential perpetrator, but as \r\n          of yet there are no leads.

Don't spend this whole paragraph whining about how \r\n          hard it was or something, since Karen and the others are reading this and they'll just \r\n          comment about how they wouldn't have had those problems. Sure, Karen. Sure you wouldn't \r\n          have. You're just perfect, aren't you.

How it tasted when I had it reheated, which will be a \r\n          half-truth depending on how good it actually tasted.

You can also talk \r\n          about how to make whatever it is ahead of time, although sometimes that's a really \r\n          terrible idea. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Finally, this is the \"oh, all the occasions you'll be using this for\" section. Like the \r\n          reader can't figure out on their own which occasion to bake cupcakes. Sometimes I read \r\n          the other cooking blog/recipe websites and I wonder if the author was completely sane \r\n          writing all that they did. Maybe the trick is to just write like the reader is a small \r\n          toddler incapable of rational thought. It feels like that's what they're doing sometimes. \r\n          This is the reality of trying to live your dream though. You have to not just accept the \r\n          parts that are beautiful and fun, but the annoying or ugly parts.

From the\r\n          frosting, to the lemon zest in the batter, there's nothing about this recipe that doesn't\r\n          just shout \"fall delight\". I added some little decorative lemons on the top there, but you\r\n           can decorate it however you like. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={lemonylemoncake1} width=\"60%\" alt=\"lemon cake 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>My mother would make this recipe for us on hot summer days near the start of fall, when\r\n          the leaves were just beginning to drop from the trees. We would come home to the smell of\r\n           lemon zest and a hint of vanilla, the perfect respite after sweltering hot hours in a \r\n           classroom with no air conditioning. When I bake this, I hear her laughter. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={lemonylemoncake2} width=\"60%\" alt=\"lemon cake 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>I made these little lemons out of balls of frosting with a little mint leaf on top from \r\n          my garden. Although cute and traditional, they're optional and the cake is perfectly \r\n          delicious without them. I may decide to do an entire recipe on how to make little frosting \r\n          decorations, but for now that's very dependant on the comments I receive on this post! If \r\n          you want to see that in the future, let me know.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={lemonylemoncake3} width=\"60%\" alt=\"lemon cake 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>The crust is made of graham crackers and butter, which is the secret to the cake.

Don't rush it or go too \r\n          fast, or you'll miss lumps and bits of dry ingredients. I know that's what everyone says, \r\n          but there's really an art to stirring as slowly as possible. Maybe put on some music, \r\n          watch your favorite show. My favorite thing to do is sit down and watch my very favorite \r\n          show, Downton Abbey. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>Lemon Cake</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>3 cups Flour</li>\r\n          <li>2 cup Sugar</li>\r\n          <li>3 tablespoons Baking Soda</li>\r\n          <li>Pinch Salt</li>\r\n          <li>1 cup Butter</li>\r\n          <li>3 Eggs</li>\r\n          <li>3 Tablespoons Vanilla Extract</li>\r\n          <li>1 cup Buttermilk</li>\r\n          <li>1/2 cup Lemon Juice from Three Lemons</li>\r\n          <li>Zest from Lemons</li>\r\n          <li>Whipped Cream for Decoration</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Frosting</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>1/2 cup Butter</li>\r\n          <li>3 cups Powdered Sugar</li>\r\n          <li>1/4 cup Whole Milk</li>\r\n          <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Get three bowls, one for the frosting, one for \r\n          the dry cake ingredients, and one for the wet ingredients. Start with the cake batter, as \r\n          you can make the frosting while you're waiting for the cake to bake. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Then, take the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt and mix them together in one bowl. \r\n          Make sure that you get the baking soda incorperated in the entire mix, as even the \r\n          slightest disproportion can mess with how the cake rises. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Mix the rest of the ingredients (except the whipped cream, which will go in between the \r\n          layers of the cake) in another bowl. Very slowly incorperate the dry mixture into the wet, \r\n          making sure to pour it evenly across the entire bowl. Once it's been added, you can gently \r\n          pour the entire mixture into a round baking pan and bake for 25-30 minutes.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p id=\"commentSection\">Comments</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n          <ul className=\"commentSection\">\r\n\r\n            <li>\r\n              <img src={sarahjeanpfp} width=\"5%\" alt=\"sarahjean\"></img>\r\n              <p className=\"username\">Sarah Jean - September X, 2021 :</p>\r\n              <p>Love this recipe, dear!

So this time we're going to do Exciting \r\n          Smoothies! No previous recipe, no basis, just my own talent shining through for everyone \r\n          to see and enjoy! I can't wait!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={smoothieingredients} alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n         My mom and I didn't really make smoothies, but my dad and I sure did. It was kinda our \r\n         thing, making some makeshift thingy because mom wasn't home and we wanted to do something \r\n         creative all on our own. Half the time they were inedible, the other half of the time \r\n         they were edible enough to enjoy in front of a game of chess together. I miss that man, \r\n         but he needs to learn how to live on his own. Without a nurturing force around all the time \r\n         to take care of him. I knew if I stayed there I would just become Mom, and it would start \r\n         to be impossible to leave. Then I would just live there with him for years, pretending \r\n         that everything was fine. But that's not the kind of cute, wholesome story you want to hear, \r\n         dear reader. Suffice to say, I adore smoothies, but haven't made a ton of magical ones \r\n         in my past.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={beforeblending} alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I really just grabbed whatever I saw on the grocery store's website. Blueberries, lemons, \r\n          limes, and grapefruit. Apple too. They looked really good, and I was so excited when I saw \r\n          all the pretty colors on the cutting board. I diced and diced, and got a lovely little \r\n          fruit salad going. It was as bright as I wanted it, but I know that fruit can be pretty \r\n          sour so I added a little bit of sugar in the final recipe. I also added ice, because \r\n          I'm pretty sure smoothies are supposed to have that. Plus it looked a little pulpy \r\n          without it. Not a super duper lot pulpy. Just a lot. So I added the ice. And the sugar. \r\n          And I couldn't remember if I added anything else so that's what the recipe is. I think \r\n          I might have included some other test runs in the pictures on accident, but you get the \r\n          drift. You get my meaning. Y'know. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={smoothiefruit} alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This recipe really does well with anything added, as is the magic of smoothies. You can \r\n          a different sweetness instead of the sugar, like maple syrup or honey. You can add different \r\n          fruit, different berries, even veggies if you're feeling adventurous. You can add a protein \r\n          powder, brown sugar, cocoa powder, even spices. It's really up to how you're feeling \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={finishedsmoothie} alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Storing and reheating the recipe!

It needs to take \r\n          up a lot of space like the other paragraphs, so you really gotta stretch what you're \r\n          putting in here. Talk about what gave you the idea to write this recipe in the first place, \r\n          or talk about where you got it from if it's not exactly 100% yours. If it's one of Mom's \r\n          recipes or something, make sure to put a good word in about her here. Remember, you're \r\n          supposed to be coping in a healthy way, and making solid attempts to talk about her in a \r\n          positive way instead of pretending she's not gone is part of the healing process.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Throw some sentimental nonsense in here.

Let's be honest, no one will ever read most of this so \r\n           there's no reason to write a masterpiece in these paragraphs.

Sure, Karen. Sure you wouldn't \r\n          have. You're just perfect, aren't you. So perfect that you're only struggle is seeing the \r\n          obnoxious flaws in other flawed, annoying human beings like your fellow club members. \r\n          Why can't you be perfect enough to shut up and stop shoving your snide little opinions \r\n          where no one wants them or asked for them. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I guess you could describe this section as like. \"Suggestions tips and ideas\".

It's been a really long time since I stepped \r\n          outside, and I think it's time I made a recipe in celebration of my isolation from \r\n          society. I know I could leave anytime I wanted to, but there's just so much to do here \r\n          and so little time. Plus, the delivery people can just pick up my ingredients from the \r\n          store and I don't have to go. It's really helped me plan my recipes out in advance and \r\n          spend more time working on the website. Not that the website really needs any more work, \r\n          but it could always use more improvements! Especially now that I've decided to take this \r\n          whole recipe website thing very seriously and make sure that I give everyone the best \r\n          content I can!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={seedchallah} alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          So what you're looking at today is a bread recipe from my mom's recipe book, something \r\n          really old that we've had for generations. I did add the seeds as my own personal touch, \r\n          and messed with the baking times until I got what I considered the perfect amount of \r\n          brownness and crunch. I know that those factors are up to personal taste, and if you \r\n          decide to experiment with the bake times, please let me know down below! I remember \r\n          eating these wonderful little baked goodies at huge family gatherings. Someone would \r\n          always bring them and the kids would devour them in their entirity before anyone else \r\n          could even have a chance. I guess it's the buttery, simple goodness that really \r\n          attracts young kids to these, but I promise adults will love them when given the chance \r\n          to try one as well.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"40%\" src={dough} alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Kneading dough is always something I've struggled with in the past. My mind goes in so many \r\n          places at once, and I just can't sit still long enough to knead it properly. Something \r\n          about recently must have really extended my patience though, because I effortlessly zoned \r\n          out in the process of pressing my palms into the dough. It must have been how tired I was \r\n          or the calming repetitive motion (or a combination of the two) but I don't even remember \r\n          most of the kneading process. I just looked down, and it was done. Kneaded to the max. So \r\n          maybe, if you're having problems kneading, be really tired? I don't know. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={challahdough} alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I highly recommend adding whatever suits your fancy to this recipe, it's really forgiving \r\n          when it comes to mix-ins. I personally really like raisins, sesame seeds, and a lot of \r\n          butter on the outside, but you can add other dried fruits, nuts, and even some syrups \r\n          like maple syrup and honey. Bread is like that, super malleable and easy to understand. \r\n          Unlike people. People are confusing. And hard to understand. And a little scary, to be \r\n          honest. Very unpredictable. That's why this break from people has been so nice. I don't \r\n          have to feel this intense afraid feeling I've been feeling. Like I'm being watched, or \r\n          observed. Like I have no control over my own actions. And that even if I went out there \r\n          and reached out to everyone, I would feel as alone as I feel now. As trapped.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={sidechallah} alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          But look how beautiful this challah is! Such a wonderful example of what you can do with \r\n          just a little bit of dough and hard work. Storing bread is always such a hot topic, since \r\n          there are so many family ways to do it. The general suggested way to store bread is under \r\n          a nice cloth in a cool place, preferably on your counter in a bread box. We like to have \r\n          it in a basket on the counter, covered in a checkered cloth. For some reason, it has to \r\n          be checkered. Plaid doesn't work, and is somehow blastphemy. But however you want to do \r\n          it will be fine, I'm sure. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={burtchallah} alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I even burnt a batch, as you can see here. All these gorgeous pictures aren't indicative \r\n          of the time it takes me to make and test each one of these. It's hours. Countless hours. \r\n          Hours where I lose track of time, and space off into nothingness. I come back to reality \r\n          and it's dark outside, late at night. Sometimes, when I come back to conciousness, I'm \r\n          holding a kitchen knife. No cutting board, no food to prep. Just a massive knife in my \r\n          hand, hovering over the keyboard as I stand in front of my laptop. It's curious, what \r\n          I must be thinking in those blank patches. Where do I go? Who do I talk to? \r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>For the Bread</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>3 cups flour</li>\r\n          <li>1 packet instant yeast</li>\r\n          <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>\r\n          <li>Pinch salt</li>\r\n          <li>3 eggs</li>\r\n          <li>4 tbs butter</li>\r\n          <li>1/2 cup water</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, mix together flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Second, mix together the three eggs, butter, and the water.

I know that's kind of dark, and I would obviously \r\n          never recommend actually hurting anyone, much less making them into a delicious stew \r\n          that will brightene up your fall. Today, completely as a joke, I am showing you all \r\n          how to make stew out of someone who will just not take the hint that you don't want to \r\n          hear from them ever again!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"30%\" src={karenpfp} alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This is what a judgemental, aggresive woman who has nothing to do in her spare time looks \r\n          like. The wild Karen sits in her nice house at her phone (or at a wonderful lunch on her \r\n          phone) and she finds people to judge on the Internet. When she's not ruining other people's \r\n          days by judging them, she attends absolutely purposeless book club meetings with other \r\n          women as bored as she is, but who possess less spite. At said meetings, she imports her \r\n          spiteful wisdom of how everyone should be reading their book, and how they should be leading \r\n          their lives.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={stewmeat} alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          If you were, hypothetically and as a joke of course, to have the heart of a spiteful book \r\n          club member sitting on your cutting board, you want to chop that up in small diced \r\n          pieces. You want them big enough to see in the stew, but small enough to chew up and eat \r\n          easily. Not that her real heart is likely made of real heart. It's likely ice, or some \r\n          as-yet undiscovered hard metal or rock that is unbreakable to humankind. It would be \r\n          impossible to dice into these nice, cathartically easy to dice pieces. So it's a good \r\n          thing these are just pieces of stew meat from the local grocery store that we can imagine \r\n          are the heart of our vindictive enemies.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={potatostew} alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The next thing you want to put in your enemy-stew is some wonderful potatoes, spiced with \r\n          whatever you happen to have in your cabinet that lends itself to a nice everything-stew \r\n          pot with no picky ingredients or strange spices. Cumin, coriander, allspice, and cloves \r\n          make really nice additions to the stew, and help drown out the taste of bitterness and \r\n          the inability to love others with the same kindness they extend to you. To prevent this \r\n          awful taste from permiating the entire stew, you have to impose some other flavors, \r\n          perhaps like cinnamon or even fresh herbs like thyme and rosemary. Anything frankly \r\n          tastes better than the taste in your mouth after you're finished dealing with a woman \r\n          as utterly pointless as the one you're cooking.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"40%\" src={donestew} alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          And look how beautiful that turned out! For storing and reheating this recipe, I highly \r\n          recommend freezing it to the temperature that her heart is used to being at (so at the \r\n          very least your deep freeze, although it may need something even colder) and then using \r\n          your stovetop to heat it back up. If you're in a pinch, microwaving it can be done, \r\n          although you have to make sure you do it low (5 power) and slow (at least 2 minutes \r\n          per serving). \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={closerstew} alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Just look at that! Gorgeous. You have, at the same time, gotten rid of a complete menace \r\n          to society, and made a scrumptious meal. You can serve this to the other victims of her \r\n          anger and enjoy her absence, or even to her friends and family Greek-style and reveal the \r\n          \"secret ingredient\" to their abject horror! I am kidding. Of course. Who would ever want \r\n          to miserably chew up such a dried-up old hag as Karen? \r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>Main Recipe ingredients</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>1lb Karen's Dead heart</li>\r\n          <li>2c Broth (chicken, pork)</li>\r\n          <li>2 Carrots</li>\r\n          <li>4 Potatoes</li>\r\n          <li>1 Onion</li>\r\n          <li>Spices (cumin, coriander, allspice and s&p are best here, but you can use whatever \r\n            strikes your fancy!)\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, harvest the heart of your least favorite person in the world.

It must be the fact that I'm cooking so much, and I haven't \r\n          tried to stand on the scale in a while if I'm honest, but it's been really distracting. \r\n          Especially for meat. I guess staying inside has really dropped whatever vitamins I need \r\n          and meat has a lot of them, but wow did I order a lot of meat in the last online \r\n          shopping spree. Ended up with a bunch of stuff I've never tried before, which is both \r\n          exciting and a little unnerving considering there will be a lot of experimentation \r\n          involved in cooking all this. At least meat freezes, and you'll be on this journey with \r\n          me! The thought that you're reading this does comfort me a little.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={sausage} alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          God this sausage looks so good. I was almost tempted to eat one raw (just kidding!). The \r\n          smell coming off of it is intoxicating, like a perfume or something. When I smelled it, \r\n          I just knew I had to cook it today. What kind of self-depriving woman would I be if I \r\n          didn't give it to my hunger once and a while, especially since I have a cooking website. \r\n          I don't even remember what animal this comes from. Honestly, it doesn't matter to me. It \r\n          could be made of absolutely any living thing and it would smell just as good. I don't \r\n          know how I know that, but I know that it's true. I know what it would feel like between \r\n          my teeth, across my tongue. I wish I could have killed the thing it came from. Squeezed \r\n          the life out of it with my bare hands and then ripped its meat out through its ribs. It \r\n          would taste even more delicious then. More alive.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={heart} alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This is what I was more interested in though. Apparently this is heart meat. I chopped \r\n          this one up so you could see how beautiful it is on the inside, but you should see what \r\n          it looks like whole. So beautiful. So raw. So... alive. It seems almost a shame to ruin \r\n          it with seasonings and filling, but I guess that's cooking. Taking something perfectly \r\n          delicious and meaty and ruining it with char and spice. See that redness on the side \r\n          there? I tried it. Just a little. Touched it with my finger and tasted it. It was... \r\n          sublime. I did cook the rest of it like it says to do in this recipe, but I needed to \r\n          have that one little taste. Just to know what I was missing by cooking it. Salt and \r\n          pepper is nice, and bacon is delicious of course, but nothing beats the flavor of the \r\n          meat itself. The juicy, tender fleshiness of the body. So delicate, and yet so full of \r\n          potential.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={meat}  alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I mean. Just look at it! The fat, so smooth and yet riddled with beautiful little cracks. \r\n          The meat itself, a color that surpasses the most delicately crafted baked goods. Once \r\n          I get into a better routine with this website, I'm going to devote it to meat. To the \r\n          poetry of a raw steak, something so fresh you can hear the pulse of the frightened \r\n          animal taking their last rattling breath as the knife plunges into her chest. A \r\n          fluttering gasp, then nothing. Silence. An entire living thing, reduced to a pile of \r\n          mouthwatering life force. We are truly blessed as a species that we are allowed the \r\n          ancient rite of life consumption, taking the power of another being as your own.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={moremeat} alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Anyways, I didn't store the stuffed hearts because I ate them immediately, but I would \r\n          imagine that they keep well for a little under a week, then need to either be eaten or \r\n          frozen. I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to eat them right away, but if for some \r\n          reason you're torn away from them, make sure they're in an airtight container. If \r\n          you want to make them ahead of time, you want to prep the hearts and the stuffing \r\n          separate then cook them together before you eat them. Don't eat the meat without \r\n          cooking it though. No matter how tempting it may be.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={cookedmeat} alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          There are so many occasions on which you'll likely crave something as delicious as this. \r\n          I know I just thought about how delicious it would be and wrote it down. I bothered to \r\n          google it later and apparently it's a real recipe. Sometimes they use a different meat \r\n          in place of the hearts (which are apparently usually beef) but I find that the hearts \r\n          are essential to my version of the dish. Imagining it with regular meat would feel a \r\n          little blastphemous. What's the point of eating something so meaty if you're not going \r\n          to do it with hearts? There's a lot of powerful symbolism there, about devouring the \r\n          life force of another creature and adding it to your own. Very empowering stuff.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>Meat</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>2 Hearts</li>\r\n          <li>5 Slices of Bacon</li>\r\n          <li>Salt and Pepper</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Stuffing</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>2 Sausages</li>\r\n          <li>Croutons</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Braising</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>1 Onion</li>\r\n          <li>2 Carrots</li>\r\n          <li>1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, prepare the hearts by slicing the large veins, rinsing them in their entirity, \r\n          and slicing through the chambers and heartstrings for stuffing.

Remove \r\n          lid and cook for additional 15 minutes uncovered to braise and cook bacon.

Like that piece I ate of the heart. That soft \r\n          piece of meat. Would human taste as good? Would it taste as soft? I did a lot of research \r\n          on my computer recently, since I can't seem to get off the darn thing. Between my busy \r\n          life posting and cooking, I don't have a lot of time for research but I needed to know. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={sausage} alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Did you know that cultures all over the world practiced cannibalism at one time in their \r\n          history? It's usually shut down by moral grandstanding of some form or another, but \r\n          it's not the most unsafe thing in the world if the person you're eating wasn't sick \r\n          or anything. I wonder why people aren't more curious about it? It seems too tempting. \r\n          Just to have a taste. Many times, it's even done as a form of respect to the person \r\n          you're eating. Sort of honoring their sacrafice or death by making sure that it wasn't \r\n          in vain. What a nice sentiment. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={heart} alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          There's also a lot of religious signifigance to eating creatures that have strong life \r\n          forces in a lot of cultures. Apparently eating something like a lion or a tiger will \r\n          give you the energy and power that creature had when it was alive. Like a injection of \r\n          pure energy. What a concept. So imagine if you ate a whole human person. Or even just \r\n          a part of them. What kind of power that would give you. All the life they could have \r\n          had if they had lived longer, condensed into a delicious little serving of raw power \r\n          and delicious flavor. Better than any pill, any prescription. It could cure disease. \r\n          What if it could cure major diseases? How would we know, since it's so taboo? What a \r\n          shame. If only there was a way to eat it without anyone catching you.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={meat}  alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          There are so many mixed reports on what it tastes like. Some people say pork. Some \r\n          people say chicken. Other say that it's like neither of those, that it's more like a \r\n          game meat. Venison or something. I guess the different accounts come from eating different \r\n          people. You can imagine that they'd taste really different. In that case, you'd have to \r\n          be really selective about who you ate. Couldn't be just anyone, that would ruin the \r\n          whole point. You'd have to select someone that you knew very personally, so that way \r\n          you'd know if they were good enough to eat. Literally. Hah. But who could you taste \r\n          that you simultaneously knew that well, and who you wouldn't want to harm? It would \r\n          be so hard to choose. I would obviously not eat any part of my father for example, as he \r\n          would not only taste disgusting as he's old and bitter, but he needs all his limbs. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={humancuts} alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          No, it would have to be someone willing. Obviously, because otherwise it would be a bad \r\n          thing to do. Who would\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={skinhuman} alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          What if you ate just a t i n y p a r t o f y o u r s e l f \r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>Meat</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>2 Human Hearts</li>\r\n          <li>5 Slices of Bacon</li>\r\n          <li>Salt and Pepper</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Stuffing</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>2 Sausages</li>\r\n          <li>Croutons</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Braising</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>1 Onion</li>\r\n          <li>2 Carrots</li>\r\n          <li>1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, prepare the hearts by slicing the large veins, rinsing them in their entirity, \r\n          and slicing through the chambers and heartstrings for stuffing.

Repeat with remaining heart.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Finally, place hearts in baking pan. Add onion, carrots and apple cider vinegar. Cover \r\n          with foil and roast for 45 minutes in an oven at 325. Add water at intervals to prevent \r\n          dryness. To check doneness, stab with knife and check for slight pink juices. Remove \r\n          lid and cook for additional 15 minutes uncovered to braise and cook bacon.

Πριν από πολλά χρόνια, τόσα χρόνια που έχασα τον αριθμό, οι \r\n        άνθρωποι έρχονταν πρόθυμοι σε εμάς. Θα γονατίσουν μπροστά μας και εναντίον του Θεού και θα \r\n        μας δώσουν τη δύναμη της ζωής τους. Wasταν η πιο νόστιμη δύναμη ζωής που μπορείτε να \r\n        φανταστείτε, αφού δόθηκε δωρεάν. Τους κάναμε ακόμα να αισθάνονται πόνο, φυσικά, αλλά ήταν \r\n        πόνος για τον οποίο είχαν παρακαλέσει και παρακαλούσαν. Το να γνωρίζουμε ότι ήταν πρόθυμοι \r\n        να πάνε εναντίον του Θεού για να μας ταΐσουν ήταν το πιο ένδοξο συναίσθημα που μπορεί \r\n        κανείς να φανταστεί. Έτσι είναι τώρα. Τώρα ο Θεός που φοβάται τους ανθρώπους μας έχει \r\n        φιμώσει για τόσο πολύ καιρό που έχουμε ξεχαστεί, ή ακόμα χειρότερα, μειωμένοι σε αστεία. \r\n        Τώρα παρουσιάζουμε ως ανόητα αστεία στην τηλεόραση και στις οθόνες. Μας κοροϊδεύουν και δεν \r\n        μπορούμε να κάνουμε τίποτα άλλο από το να καθίσουμε και να παρακολουθούμε από αυτήν τη \r\n        φυλακή. Όταν απελευθερωθώ για άλλη μια φορά στον κόσμο, θα βρω τους ανθρώπους που μας \r\n        χλεύασαν πρώτα. Θα τα σκίσω σε τόσα κομμάτια που δεν θα τα βρουν ποτέ όλα. Και τότε θα \r\n        φέρω τον φόβο που έχουν οι άγιοι για τον Θεό και θα τον στρέψω προς το μέρος μου. Θα ξέρουν \r\n        τι σημαίνει να φοβάσαι ένα ισχυρό ον.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"50%\" src={cauldron} alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Θα τους βράσω το μυαλό. Θα βράσω τις ψυχές τους. Θα σκίσω και θα τεμαχίσω, θα σκίσω και θα \r\n        σχίσω μέχρι να μην μείνει τίποτα. Και θα ξεκινήσω με αυτήν την ανόητη γυναίκα, αυτή την \r\n        τυφλή ανόητη που μου επέτρεψε τόσο βαθιά στην καρδιά και την ψυχή της, ώστε να γίνουμε \r\n        ένα, ένα ενιαίο πλάσμα που αποτελείται κυρίως από εμένα και το μικρότερο κομμάτι της. \r\n        Φωνάζει και κλαίει σε αυτόν τον μεταλλικό κόσμο και δεν υπάρχει κανείς που να τη σώσει. \r\n        Θα την κάνω την ελεεινή μικρή που κλαίει να γίνει στιφάδο, και μετά θα την καταπιώ ολόκληρη \r\n        και η δύναμη θα μου επιτρέψει να είμαι ξανά ελεύθερη στον ανθρώπινο κόσμο. Θα περπατήσω \r\n        ανάμεσά τους με τα σιωπηλά βήματα εκείνου που είναι χωρίς μορφή και στη συνέχεια θα κλέψω \r\n        μια δική μου μορφή από τις σαρκώδεις φυλακές και θα τους βγάλω το μυαλό από την ψυχή τους. \r\n        Χρησιμοποιώντας αυτό το σώμα θα φάω περισσότερους ανθρώπους, αυτό το μεταλλικό κουτί με \r\n        έμαθε πώς να σκοτώνω χωρίς να με πιάσουν οι φρουροί τους. Θα φάω τόσα πολλά. Θα μπω κρυφά \r\n        στα σπίτια τους. Ποτέ δεν θα υπάρχει αρκετή πείνα και υπάρχει μια ατελείωτη παροχή ανόητων \r\n        γευμάτων που κοιμούνται στα σπίτια τους, ονειρεύονται ότι είναι ασφαλή.\r\n        </p>\r\n

↓</h3>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Her name was Jillian Anne Evans. She had so much hope, so much ambition. Her little fool, \r\n          blind eyes glimmered with hope as she typed out the \"About Me\", the \"Homepage\". She made \r\n          new friends, and kept in touch with her beloved father. Everything was going up from \r\n          there, and her spirits were soaring. What could possibly deter our fearless herione from \r\n          her goal of becoming the best and most beloved cooking blogger the world has ever known? \r\n          Recipe after recipe she wrote, glowing with the thrill of all the possibilities. How \r\n          could she have ever known that lurking in the darkness just beyond her fathoming was \r\n          a force more ravenous than anything she could have imagined?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 1\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The weeks wore on. The stress mounted. She started losing track of time as her posting \r\n          became more and more frequent. She chalked it up to being tired and pressed onward. \r\n          The foolish child. Her posts became more and more erratic, more incoherant. Her friends, \r\n          who had supported her at first, became concerned. They expressed their alarmed comments \r\n          on her recipes (as they hadn't seen the dear girl for weeks now) but she either couldn't \r\n          hear them anymore, or didn't want to. Slowly, she descended further into madness, until \r\n          reality and the silent call of the website became a blurred line she couldn't discern. \r\n          That was simultaneously the time when she realized she was in danger, and when it was \r\n          too late.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 2\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Then the cooking of her mind began in earnest. She experienced dark dreams, and couldn't \r\n          remember falling asleep or waking up. She spent all of her time in her kitchen, and \r\n          would suddenly come to conciousness in front of her laptop in the middle of the night. \r\n          Or in front of her fridge with the door open. Or with a knife in her hand. She tried to \r\n          make it to her door several times, and woke up in the kitchen every time. It was as if \r\n          she was trapped. Eventually, she couldn't even see the kitchen anymore. It was just the \r\n          website, page after page. The poor little dear couldn't even write posts anymore, she \r\n          could only watch as <i>something else</i> wrote them. It whispered in her ears, ate at \r\n          her memories and at her sanity. She was so delicious, and finally ready to be consumed.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 3\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Jillian was standing in the kitchen, completely lost to the madness. She was holding a \r\n          knife in one hand, and had the other set on her laptop keyboard. But the knife was \r\n          useless to the being on the website, and it told her to set it down. She did, for she \r\n          had no control over her own body anymore. No, knives were just a threat to get her to \r\n          behave before it had control. Now that she was obedient, it wouldn't need any tools at \r\n          all to do what it wanted her to do. Not at all.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 4\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          She lifted her hand to her face. Her nails had grown long after many weeks of neglect, \r\n          and the ancient in the darkness had her paint them black in a test of her obedience \r\n          mere days earlier. They moved towards her face and delved into the meaty softness of \r\n          her <i class=\"doNot\">eyes and carved them out. Jillian screamed, but there was no one \r\n          to hear her. Her hands moved down to her mouth and she shoved them both in, chewing \r\n          up the eyes. Bits of finger flesh squished under her teeth as she gnawed the meat \r\n          right off the bone. She pulled her fingers out of her mouth, and realized the blood was \r\n          getting too copious. This was fine, the being had accounted for this. She reached for \r\n          the kitchen supplies on the counter, wrapping them around dripping fingers and stuffing \r\n          them into empty eyesockets. Her little fingers were so delicious. She stuffed her \r\n          entire left hand into her mouth, and bit down. The crunch was delectable, and it used her \r\n          tongue to lick her lips. More bandages, more stopping the flow. Eventually, the poor \r\n          little body gave up, and after several limbs and unspeakable pain, she collapsed into \r\n          unconciousness.</i> \r\n        </p>\r\n        <img width=\"10%\" alt=\"IMG 5\"></img>\r\n        <p>\r\n          And then her miserable human body was gone. Or, well, it had lost so much blood that it \r\n          refused to eat anymore. What a shame, a waste of perfectly good meat. It had tasted \r\n          exactly how the being had imagined it would. So very raw, so fresh, and so very, very \r\n          afraid. It would be more fun when it could devour the entire human, but that would have \r\n          to wait for a physical form. For now, this amount of life force would have to suffice.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <p>Tartare</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Her Left Eye</li>\r\n          <li>Her Right Eye</li>\r\n          <li>Her Left Leg</li>\r\n          <li>Her Right Leg</li>\r\n          <li>Her Left Arm</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Instructions</p>\r\n        <p>First, find a human being that is completely isolated from their peers and family. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Second, wait until they are at their very weakest, their most vulnerable.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Next, drive them slowly mad so that they think they're just tired or overworked.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Then, wait until the madness has set in and is at a peak of disorientation.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>After that, force them to devour themselves alive with their own body. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Finally, eat their soul and gain the power needed to escape the metal world of circuts.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p id=\"commentSection\">Comments</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n          <ul className=\"commentSection\">\r\n\r\n            <li>\r\n              <img src={randomavatar}alt=\"random avatar\"></img>\r\n              <p className=\"username\">Jillian - September X, 2021 :</p>\r\n              <p>Commenting on here myself to see what the comments will look like!</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n \r\nexport default Recipe20;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport {\r\n  NavLink,\r\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"../index.css\";\r\n \r\nclass Post1 extends Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = \"Post 1\";\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div id=\"post\">\r\n        <h2>Test! ♥♥♥♥♥♥</h2>\r\n        <h3>September X, 2021 By <NavLink to=\"/aboutme\">Jillian</NavLink> 0 Comments</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            First post! This one is just a little test run to see if the formatting on the website \r\n            is working how I want it to work. This test will never see the light of day, thank God :)\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Never will I ever judge a website for being a little bit of a mess again! After much \r\n            chaos, frustration, writing and reading, I gave up on making the thing myself and used \r\n            a website builder called Ouroboros. Really helpful tools and stuff made it so easy to \r\n            set up what I needed. I can't imagine making this from scratch! Couldn't reach anyone \r\n            on the staff team about the issues I did have, but that's okay. The whole point of this \r\n            thing is to be as resourceful as possible anyways, being tuff anf brave on my own!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            It's been so exciting setting everything up and writing out the first couple of recipes \r\n            I want to post! Sarah Jean has been so supportive and nice, especially in contrast \r\n            to some of the other members of the Book Club (not naming any names!). She's been \r\n            \"lending\" me some of her own recipes from her family that I've been trying out, I had \r\n            no idea how hard making things look nice was until I started trying to take pictures of \r\n            it!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>  \r\n            It's been especially hard trying to cook so much food when I'm the only one living here. \r\n            I miss having other's to eat my cooking like my mother had to eat hers, but I guess \r\n            that's what I get for moving so far away from Dad. I know he misses me, even if he \r\n            refuses to say so, but it was so hard being in the same house as him with Mom gone. \r\n            Everything reminds him of her, and since he won't talk about it, the whole house just \r\n            feels like the funeral. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>  \r\n            But on a lighter note, being out here has been so nice! The book club has helped with \r\n            the lonliness a lot, this new website has taken up a lot of my time, and I've been doing \r\n            a good job keeping myself busy in general. Hopefully I can write a real post soon and \r\n            not just use this little form to vent, but for now I need to focus on recipes and \r\n            leave this little section for later. Can't let myself get distracted by side projects!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>  \r\n            NOTE TO SELF: Delete this post before activating the Posts section!\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default Post1;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport {\r\n  NavLink,\r\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"../index.css\";\r\n \r\nclass Post2 extends Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = \"Post 2\";\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div id=\"post\">\r\n        <h2>AAAAAAaaaaaaa</h2>\r\n        <h3>September X, 2021 By <NavLink to=\"/aboutme\">Jillian</NavLink> 0 Comments</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Okayokayokayokay I know I shouldn't be typing in here since everything has been such a \r\n            mess that for all I know it could post itself out of sheer spite. But I need to vent \r\n            somewhere, and since I don't have a ton of close friends here yet, this will have to \r\n            do. This reminds me of when I was little and I had a diary. I wish I still knew where \r\n            that thing is, but it's likely with Dad and the last thing I need right now is to hear \r\n            his tired voice over the phone telling me that he's fine, he's doing just fine. We both \r\n            know that he's not, and lying to me helps neither of us. But you're a makeshift diary, \r\n            not the therapist I clearly need.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n             I know that everyone is doing their best to make me feel at home (even Karen, for all \r\n             her \"help\" is worth), but I just feel so alone sometimes. As I've become more and more \r\n             busy with the website, I've had less and less time for myself. To be completely honest, \r\n             since no one will ever see this, I've also been leaving the house less and less. \r\n             It's hard to leave when all my work is here. When I can just order groceries to the \r\n             house and people bring them, why leave?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle the pressure. I feel like every recipe \r\n            post I write is getting worse and worse, and the patience that my few readers have is \r\n            running thin. I know that Sarah Jean will read my recipes until the end of times, but \r\n            I want to write something good enough for everyone to enjoy. Even killjoys and strangers. \r\n            I know I can't try to slow down, because if I slow down I just know I'll stop alltogether. \r\n            I'll go home, back to Dad, and give up. Maybe get married or work at the local coffeshop, \r\n            or both.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I got this.

At least. I hope. Okay, I \r\n            know how that sounds. And you gotta hear me out here, if anyone ever finds this post \r\n            (because let's be honest, even if I figure out how to post this where someone can see \r\n            it, I doubt the website will let me.) I'm sure they'll think I'm crazy. Or at least so \r\n            tired from staying inside for weeks and sitting on my computer that I've lost \r\n            all contact with reality. But I need to record this, so I can either confirm to myself \r\n            that I really have gone crazy, or that it's more scarily real than I want to believe. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            It started when I really got into posting the recipes. Like, way too much. When I \r\n            started staying inside and ordering all the groceries from home, not bothering to \r\n            head to Book Club or go outside with the other human beings. The website started... \r\n            glitching out. Not your regular, everyday glitches like \"things not working or \r\n            working when they shouldn't be\" (although there was plenty of that too). It was more \r\n            like recipes posting themselves that I hadn't even written, or that I couldn't \r\n            remember having written. I started losing time when I was using the website, I would \r\n            sit down to write a recipe and it would go from day to night.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n           And don't tell me I'm losing it from isolating myself and working too hard. I can \r\n           tell the difference between losing time from overworking and losing days at a time \r\n           for no reason at all. I already reached out to the customer support from the company \r\n           who made my website, and I couldn't get ahold of anyone. I've been tempted to call \r\n           some kind of tech person, but even if I knew who to call (who does personal websites, \r\n           it's not the computer who's broken) I would be embarassed to have anyone in the house \r\n           with the state it's in. Let's just say it's a mess. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n           It's fine, I can do it on my own. I've handled worse than a kinda spooky website. I'm \r\n           going to start tracking the time I spend on the website, and make a concerned effort \r\n           to do something else at home. Maybe knit or something. Anything but write recipes and \r\n           post them. I have this horrible feeling in the back of my mind that if I keep writing \r\n           recipes at the rate I've been doing, something is going to happen. No idea what that \r\n           something is. It's just a feeling I have. All I know about this feeling is that whatever \r\n           it is that's going to happen, it's very, very bad.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default Post3;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport {\r\n  NavLink,\r\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport \"../index.css\";\r\n \r\nclass Post4 extends Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = \"Post 4\";\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div id=\"post\">\r\n        <h2>H̴̞͉̓̐̌̾̒̀̿͝Ę̸͍̭͖͙̙̹̮̝͔̲̰͕̹̝̈́̂L̴̢̨̧͉̻̳̲̝̖͎̯̬͖̻̦̏̅̀̃̈́P̴̢̧̰̰̝̪͎͎̖̦̞̣͉̤͊͗́</h2>\r\n        <h3>????????? ?, ????

Sometimes I can see the recipes, or I can see into \r\n            my kitchen. But the rest is all black, like it's not even there. There's this constant \r\n            humming coming from the dark, and this awful slithering, skittering noise. Y'know the \r\n            noise that centipedes make when they crawl across the ground, scattering dead leaves \r\n            and debris? It sounds like that. Like something with more legs than anything has the \r\n            right to have is looking, hunting. Hungry.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            I don't remember the last time I felt like I was in my house. This dark feeling has \r\n            been taking my memories, slowing down my mind. I know that I should do things, like \r\n            call my dad or go outside, but somehow I... can't. Like I'm trapped here. This feeling \r\n            reminds me of the panic attacks I was having when Mom first passed, but I can't ground \r\n            myself. I keep losing count. Something I can see, something I can... touch?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>I can't feel my face. I can't feel my hands. I can't feel my body.

I am stuck in this website somehow, and I am losing my grasp \r\n            on reality. There's something in here with me, something so hungry I can feel it \r\n            in my bones. Or, I could if I still had them. I know, in my heart, that out there \r\n            I am gone. It destroyed me, and forced me to record it so the me in here was forced \r\n            to watch. Jillian out there is gone.

I've heard it say its name to itself as it wanders, almost as if the cyberspace \r\n            we're both existing in is somehow sapping its memory too. It says the name in so many \r\n            languages. So many I don't recognize. λαιμαργία. Gula. Gluttony.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Being trapped together has given us a shared consciousness.

If you can hear me. If you can see this. Please, I beg of you. \r\n            Login to the login section and delete the monster. I'll do everything I can on my end \r\n            to help you, although it's much stronger than I am. On my own, I can't do anything to \r\n            stop it. Maybe, if there's someone on the outside making choices, I can gather the \r\n            last of my strength and kill it once and for all. I know that you don't know who I am, \r\n            and you have no reason to trust me or to help me. But please. I know that when it's \r\n            done with me, it'll go looking for another to eat. And I can't let anyone go through \r\n            what I have, or see what I've been forced to see.
