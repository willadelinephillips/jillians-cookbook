//Darkness. Nothing immediately visible in screen. Chewing noises offscreen.
Jillian: So...... hungry....
//Unintelligible whispering in the background. 
//Jillian's arm thuds onto a surface from seemingly under it. In her single hand she holds red meat
//Her mouth comes into frame. Her lipstick is destroyed but clearly the same one she always wears.
//She shoves the meat into her mouth, gagging and softly crying.

//She eats more furiously, reaching down and grabbing handfulls of the mystery meat. 
//The whispering gets louder, almost indescernably words
Gluttony: Eat it eat it eat it eatiteatiteatiteatit EAT IT. EAT IT, JILLIAN, EAT IT
