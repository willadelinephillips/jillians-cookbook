        <p>Welcome, my name is Jillian! It's been my dream my entire life to have a food website. 
          Even when I was a little girl pretending to cook in my little pastic kitchen, I imagined 
          an audience that was watching me. I told them about the ingredients I was using, the way 
          I had decided to maket the recipe, and what personal touches I was adding. When I got 
          older, it was my way of connecting with those I love. My mother, my father, and my friends. 
          Our family didn't express a lot of love through words or hugs, but through our cooking 
          instead. When my mother passed, the primary thing she left me was her cookbook, full of 
          notes and tips and tricks. It's my most treasured possession.

        <p>Thank you for being here, on my website with me. It means a lot to know that my dream 
          is being realized, no matter if you're a close personal friend or a stranger out here 
          on the 'Web. Your happiness in these recipes is my happiness in your enjoyment. Please, 
          leave a comment, send me a picture of your recipe. Show me how much (or how little) it 
          changed your event or meal. It means the world to hear about how my writing has affected 
          you, even if it's just a critique. Critiques mean that I learn and get better!
