# Jillian's Cookbook 
## A Horror ARG Project made in React

Welcome! Jillian's Cookbook is a full-scale ARG complete with an engaging storyline, affects that change acress the course of the website, and interesting visual affects that use various abilities that only the web possesses. 

## Storyline 

Jillian Evans is a young woman trying to achieve her dream to be the best recipe website owner the world has ever seen. She creates a website from scratch and starts writing, posting to anyone who will listen. Her recipes need some polishing, sure, but her ambition far outweighs the odds she's facing to make it big. No one in the real world seems to be hearing outside of her group of close friends, but in the virtual space there are ears everywhere. More than she could have imagined. 

Someone does hear her, in the inky blackness of the Web, but it's not who she was expecting. Some*thing* hungry, and far more ancient than the circuts and connections that keep it alive. And that unexpected visitor takes her life apart piece by piece, and devours her alive.
